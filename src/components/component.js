/**
 * This is the base class for all UI classes in the Layer UI Framework.
 *
 * It works with the webcomponent API/polyfill to define components that:
 *
 * * Provides getters/setters/defaults for all defined properties
 * * Read the widget's attributes on being initialized, copying them into properties and triggering property setters
 * * Provides created and destroyed callbacks
 * * Provides onReady and onAttach hooks for custom Mixins
 * * Automate standard template-related tasks
 * * Automate standard event-related tasks
 *
 * Methods and properties defined here should only be needed by developers wishing to build new widgets or evolve existing widgets.
 * Note that widgets can be created using other frameworks based on the webcomponent polyfill and still work here.
 *
 * A new component is created using:
 *
 * ```
 * var componentDefinition = {
 *   events: ['event-one', 'event-two', 'event-three', 'event-four'],
 *   mixins: [mixinObj1, mixinObj2, mixinObj3],
 *   properties: {
 *      prop1: {
 *          set: function(value) {
 *              this.myRenderer();
 *          }
 *      },
 *      prop2: {
 *          get: function() {
 *              return this.scrollTop;
 *          }
 *      },
 *      prop3: {
 *          value: "Frodo is a Dodo"
 *      },
 *      prop4: {
 *          type: Function
 *      }
 *   },
 *   methods: {
 *     onCreate: function() {
 *        alert("The widget has been created");
 *     },
 *     myRenderer: function() {
 *        this.innerHTML = this.properties.prop1;
 *     }
 *   }
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * A component defined this way can be registered as follows:
 *
 * ```
 * var layerUI = require('websdk-ui-webcomponents');
 * layerUI.registerComponent(componentDefinition);
 * ```
 *
 * ### Properties
 *
 * A property definition can be as simple as:
 *
 * ```
 * layerUI.registerComponent({
 *    properties: {
 *       prop1: {}
 *    }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The above code declares `prop1` to be a property, sets up a setter that writes `widget.properties.prop1` any time `widget.prop1` is set,
 * and sets up a getter to read the value from `widget.properties.prop1`.  It also insures that at initialization time, if a `prop1` attribute
 * is found, it will be used as the `prop1` property.
 *
 * Property Definitions support the following keys:
 *
 * *  set: A setter function whose input is the new value.  Note that your setter function is called AFTER this.properties.propName
 *    has been set with the new value; your setter is for any side effects, rendering updates, or additional processing and NOT
 *    for writing the value itself.
 * *  get: A getter is needed if getting the property value from `this.properties.propName` is not getting the latest value.
 *    Perhaps you want to return `this.nodes.input.value` to get text typed in by a user.
 * *  value: If a `value` key is provided, then this will be the default value of your property, to be used if a value is
 *    not provided by the component creator.
 * *  type: Currently accepts `Boolean`, `Number`, `Function`.  Using a type makes the system
 *    more forgiving when processing strings.  This exists because attributes frequently arrive as strings due to the way HTML attributes work.
 *    For example:
 *    * if type is Boolean, and "false", "null", "undefined", "" and "0" are evaluated as `false`; all other values are `true`
 *    * Using this with functions will cause your function string to be evaled, but will lose your function scope and `this` pointer.
 *    * Using this with a number will turn "1234" into `1234`
 *
 * Example
 *
 * ```
 *  isEnabled: {
 *    type: Boolean,
 *    value: true,
 *    set: function(inValue) {
 *       this.classList.toggle('widget-enabled', inValue);
 *    },
 *    get: function() {
 *       return this.classList.contains('widget-enabled');
 *    }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Events
 *
 * As part of your layerUI.components.Component.registerComponents call you can pass in an `events` array; this is an array of strings representing events to listen for,
 * and provide as property-based event listeners.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * layerUI.registerComponent({
 *    events: ['layer-something-happening', 'layer-nothing-happening', 'your-custom-event']
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The above component definition will result in:
 *
 * 1. The component will listen for the 3 events listed, regardless of whether this component triggered the event,
 *    or its child components triggered the event.
 * 2. The component will define the following properties: `onSomethingHappening`, `onNothingHappening` and `onYourCustomEvent`. These properties
 *    are defined for you, you do not need to do anything more than list the events in the events array.
 * 3. Your app can now use either event listeners or property callbacks as illustrated below:
 *
 * Event Listeners:
 *
 * ```
 * document.body.addEventListener('layer-something-happening', myFunc);
 * document.body.addEventListener('layer-nothing-happening', myFunc);
 * document.body.addEventListener('your-custom-event', myFunc);
 * ```
 *
 * Property callbacks:
 * ```
 * widget.onSomethingHappening = myFunc;
 * widget.onNothingHappening = myFunc;
 * widget.onYourCustomEvent = myFunc;
 * ```
 *
 * ### Methods
 *
 * You may provide any methods you want within the `methods` hash; be aware though that some methods names
 * are reserved for use by the framework, and some have specific life-cycle implications for the widget.
 *
 * #### Reserved
 *
 * The following method names are reserved:
 *
 * * `createdCallback`
 * * `attachedCallback`
 * * `detachedCallback`
 * * `attributeChangedCallback`
 *
 * ### Mixins
 *
 * Mixins can be added to a widget in two ways:
 *
 * * A Component may add a `mixins` array to its definition
 * * An Application, initializing the framework via `layerUI.init()` may pass in mixins into the `init` call.
 *
 * #### Using Mixins from the Component
 *
 * A component can include any number of Mixins by adding them to the `mixins` Array:
 *
 * ```
 * // Define a Mixin that can contains `properties`, `methods` and `events`:
 * var mixinObj = {
 *   properties: {
 *     prop2: {}
 *   },
 *   methods: {
 *     method2: function() {
 *       alert("I two Met Hed; he was a little nerdy");
 *     }
 *   }
 * });
 *
 * // Add mixinObj to our Component
 * var componentDefinition = {
 *   mixins: [mixinObj],
 *   properties: {
 *      prop1: {
 *          set: function(value) {
 *              this.myRenderer();
 *          }
 *      }
 *   },
 *   methods: {
 *     method1: function() {
 *       alert("I Met Hed; he was nice");
 *     }
 *   }
 * });
 *
 * // Create a Component with prop1, prop2, method1 and method2
 * registerComponent(componentDefinition);
 * ```
 *
 * An app can modify an existing component by adding custom mixins to it using `layerUI.init()`.  The `mixins` parameter
 * takes as keys, the tag-name for any widget you want to customize;
 * (e.g `layer-messages-item`, `layer-messages-list`, `layer-conversation-panel`, etc...)
 *
 * The following example adds a search bar to the Message List:
 *
 * ```
 * // Define a Mixin that can contains `properties`, `methods` and `events`:
 * var mixinObj = {
 *   properties: {
 *     prop2: {}
 *   },
 *   methods: {
 *     method2: function() {
 *       alert("I two Met Hed; he was a little nerdy");
 *     }
 * });
 *
 * layerUI.init({
 *   appId: 'my-app-id',
 *   mixins: {
 *     'layer-messages-item': mixinObj
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Mixin Behaviors
 *
 * Your mixin can be used to:
 *
 * * Add new Events to the widget's `events` array (presumably one of your new methods will call `this.trigger('my-event-name')`)
 * * Add new properties
 * * Add new methods
 * * Add new behaviors to existing properties
 * * Add new behaviors to existing methods
 * * Overwrite existing methods
 *
 * ##### Adding an Event
 *
 * ```
 * var mixinObj = {
 *   events: ['mycompany-button-click'],
 *   methods: {
 *     onCreate: function() {
 *       this.nodes.button = document.createElement('button');
 *       this.appendChild(this.nodes.button);
 *       this.nodes.button.addEventListener('click', this._onMyCompanyButtonClick.bind(this));
 *     },
 *     _onMyCompanyButtonClick: function(evt) {
 *       this.trigger('mycompany-button-click', { message: this.item.message });
 *     }
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * When the user clicks on the `this.nodes.button`, it will trigger the `mycompany-button-click` event.  By listing
 * `mycompany-button-click` event in the `events` array, this will automatically add the `onMycompanyButtonClick` property
 * which you can set to your event handler (or you may just use `document.addEventListener('mycompany-button-click', callback)`).
 *
 * ##### Add new behaviors to existing properties
 *
 * If you are modifying a widget that has an existing property, and you want additional side effects to
 * trigger whenever that property is set, you can add your own `set` method to the property.
 * Other modifications to the property will be ignored (`value` and `get` from mixin will be ignored).
 *
 * ```
 * var mixinObj = {
 *   properties: {
 *     client: {
 *       set: function(client) {
 *         this.properties.user = client.user;
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * The above mixin can be added to any widget;
 *
 * * If the widget already has a `client` property, both the widget's setter and your setter will be called; order of call is not predetermined.
 * * If the widget does *not* already have a `client`, your `client` setter will be called if/when the `client` is set.
 *
 * You can use the Mixin to add any method your widget needs.
 *
 * You can also use the Mixin to enhance methods already provided by your widget:
 *
 * ```
 * var mixinObj = {
 *   methods: {
 *     onCreate: function() {
 *         var div = document.createElement('div');
 *         this.appendChild(div);
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * The above mixin can be added to any widget; the widget's `onCreate` method will be called, AND your `onCreate` method will be called, in no
 * particular order.  You an also use the following `mode` values to change ordering:
 *
 * * `layerUI.registerComponent.MODES.BEFORE`: Call your mixin's method before the widget's method
 * * `layerUI.registerComponent.MODES.AFTER`: Call your mixin's method after the widget's method
 * * `layerUI.registerComponent.MODES.OVERWRITE`: Call only your mixin's method, *not* the widget's method
 * * `layerUI.registerComponent.MODES.DEFAULT`: Call your mixin's method in no particular order with regards to the widget's methods
 *
 * ```
 * var mixinObj = {
 *   methods: {
 *     onCreate: {
 *       mode: layerUI.registerComponent.MODES.BEFORE,
 *       value: function() {
 *         var div = document.createElement('div');
 *         this.appendChild(div);
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * You can also define a `conditional` on your methods; if any `conditional` function returns `false`, then none of the `BEFORE`, `AFTER`, `DEFAULT` or `OVERWRITE` methods are called:
 *
 * ```
 * var mixinObj = {
 *   methods: {
 *     onRender: {
 *       conditional: function() {
 *         return Boolean(this.item);
 *       },
 *       mode: layerUI.registerComponent.MODES.BEFORE,
 *       value: function() {
 *         var div = document.createElement('div');
 *         this.appendChild(div);
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * For details on what methods to modify via mixins, see the Life Cycle methods
 *
 * #### Life Cycle Methods
 *
 * All widgets should execute the following life cycle methods:
 *

1. `onCreate()`: Your widget has been created.
    * Uses for `onCreate`:
      * Setup event handlers
      * Add custom nodes and properties that do not depend upon property values
      * Setup local variables/state variables.
    * Widget State when `onCreate` is called:
      * If you have a template, it will have been loaded into your widget before `onCreate`, adding any neccessary child nodes
      * `this.nodes` will be setup and point to any nodes in your template that specify a `layer-id`.
      * If your widget was created with any attributes, they _may_ be available in `this.properties` but you should not depend upon them being set yet.
      * No property setters will have been called yet
      * Your widget will not have a `parentNode`
1. Property Setters: Your property setters will be called with any attributes and/or properties that your widget was initialized with.
   * The following widget `<my-widget prop1='frodo' prop2='dodo'></my-widget>` will call your setter for `prop1`
     with `frodo`, and `prop2` with `dodo`
   * Default property values will be set; a property defined like this: `properties: { prop1: { value: 55, set: function(newValue) {alert('Set!');} } }` will cause the `prop1` setter will be called with `55`
   * Any properties set via `var element = document.createElement('widget'); element.prop1 = 'frodo';` will fire at this point as well.
   * If no attribute value is passed in and no default value is set the `prop1` setter will *not* be called, and the value will be `null`
1. `onAfterCreate()`: Your widget has been initialized.
    * Uses for `onAfterCreate`:
      * Setup and DOM manipulation that depends upon property values (else it would go in `onCreate`)
      * One time DOM manipulation based on property values that never change.  Any DOM manipulation based on values that change
        would typically go in `onRender` which can be called repeatedly.
    * Widget state when `onAfterCreate` is called:
      * `onCreate` has been called
      * Property setters have all fired
      * `onRender` has **not**  been called
1. `onRender()`: DOM manipulation based on current property values.
    * Uses for `onRender`:
      * Typically called after a property value changes that would force the widget to rerender.  Note that for very specific and simple DOM changes,
        the property setter may directly update the DOM rather than call `onRender`.
      * Unlike `onAfterCreate`, `onRender` may be called multiple times
      * Note that this is called immediately after `onAfterCreate`,
      * Note that calls to `onRender` from your property setters will beo ignored until `onAfterCreate` has been called.
    * Widget state when `onRender` is called:
      * The first call will be before `onAttach`; subsequent calls may happen before or after this widget has a `parentNode`
      * `onCreate`, all property setters, and `onAfterCreate` have been called.
1. `onRerender()`: Widgets that render a Layer Web SDK Object listen for changes to the object and call `onRerender` to update rendering
   of things that can change within those objects.  Unlike `onRender` which would let you render an entirely new Message or Conversation,
   `onRerender` would handle changes within the existing Message or Conversation.  `onRerender` is also used when listening for events
   rather than changes to properties.
1. `onAttach()`: Your widget has been added to a document.
    * Uses for `onAttach`:
      * Your widget needs to know its `parentNode` to modify its rendering.
      * Your widget needs some sizing information to modify its rendering.
    * Widget state when `onAttach` is called:
      * `onRender` will always be called before `onAttach`.
      * `parentNode` should now have a value.
      * Removing this widget from the DOM and then reinserting it _may_ refire this call.  It will Not refire `onRender`.
1. `onDetach()`: Your widget has been removed from the html document.
1. `onDestroy()`: Your widget was has been flagged as destroyed.  This happens if it was removed from the HTML Document, and remained out of
   the document for more than a few moments. Use this function to unsubscribe from any custom event listeners you setup for your widget.
